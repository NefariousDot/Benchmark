# Benchmark

#### A total of ten different benchmarks are used to test the performance of Embedded in this chapter. Each type of benchmarks has its unique focal point for testing.For example, some benchmarks only operate on variables whose data type is an integer, while others work on data whose data type is a floating-point number.All of them are written in C.

## Fibonacci Sequence

As one of the classic mathematical models, the Fibonacci sequence was discovered by the mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci. Specifically, it refers to a sequence like this 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34... The sequence starts at term 3, and each term is equal to the sum of the previous two. And in mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is recursively represented as

'''
F (0) = 0,
F (1) = 1,
F (n) = F (n − 1) + F (n − 2)(n ≥ 2, n ∈ N )
'''

It is defined as a critical number sequence used in modern physical chemistry and other fields.
