# Benchmark

## A total of ten different benchmarks are used to test the performance of Embedded in this chapter. Each type of benchmarks has its unique focal point for testing.For example, some benchmarks only operate on variables whose data type is an integer, while others work on data whose data type is a floating-point number.All of them are written in C.
